**CI/CD Integration for Automated Code Deployment**

This repository is part of a CI/CD pipeline designed to automate the deployment of code to a client’s server. The pipeline integrates three GitHub repositories: Admin Frontend, Admin Backend, and a Common/Shared Repository. It ensures that code pushed to these repositories is automatically deployed to the client's server within a specified time window, with proper logging and error handling.

**Overview**

The goal of this CI/CD pipeline is to ensure continuous and automated deployment without downtime. The pipeline uses GitHub Webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds upon a push event, which then orchestrates the deployment process. The deployment is scheduled according to the client’s specified time window to avoid service interruptions.

**Key Features:**

Automatic Deployment: Whenever there is a push to any of the three GitHub repositories, Jenkins triggers a deployment.
Scheduled Deployments: The deployment will be executed during the client’s selected time window to avoid downtime.
Error Handling: If the deployment fails at any step, detailed logs are generated to help with troubleshooting.
Multi-repository Integration: The pipeline integrates with three GitHub repositories—Admin Frontend, Admin Backend, and Common Repository.

**Prerequisites**

Before setting up and running the CI/CD pipeline, ensure that you have the following:

**GitHub Repositories:**

Admin Frontend: your-org/admin-frontend
Admin Backend: your-org/admin-backend
Common Repository: your-org/common-repo

We can also setup branches for the above three and later can use inside if-else block.

**Jenkins Setup:**

A Jenkins server installed and running.
Jenkins pipelines configured to receive webhook triggers and handle the deployment steps.
GitHub Webhook Configuration: Set up webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs on push events. Each repository will need a corresponding webhook to notify Jenkins.

Deployment Server Access:

SSH or other required access to the client's server.
Deployment credentials or API keys to perform deployment actions.

**Pipeline Flow**

Step 1: Push Event

A developer pushes code to one of the repositories (Admin Frontend, Admin Backend, or Common).
This push event triggers a GitHub webhook, notifying Jenkins that a new commit has been made.

Step 2: Jenkins Job Triggered

Jenkins picks up the webhook event and triggers the corresponding job.
The job initiates the deployment process as defined in the Jenkins pipeline configuration.

Step 3: Scheduled Deployment

The deployment is scheduled based on the client’s preferred time window to avoid service downtime. This can be configured in Jenkins as part of the pipeline settings.
If the push happens outside the desired window, the job is either queued or postponed based on configuration.

Step 4: Deployment Process

Jenkins handles the deployment steps such as:
Pulling the latest changes from GitHub.
Building or packaging the application (if necessary).
Deploying the updated code to the client’s server.

Step 5: Error Handling and Logging (In Development)

If any part of the deployment fails, detailed logs are generated and stored in Jenkins for debugging.
Notifications are sent to stakeholders (via email, Slack, or other integrations) to inform them of the failure.

Step 6: Success Notification

Once the deployment succeeds, a success message is logged, and stakeholders are notified.
